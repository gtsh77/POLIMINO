# POLIMINO
puzzle based on polimino (not tetromino) with NES89 theme [ALPHA]

PROJECT PROGRESS: https://trello.com/b/vBuHEzTA/2d-battlemino

Some project ideas:

1. game can be based on array data struct, broadcasted by server
2. need to convert dom render to canvas render (this can't be done w/o rewriting 50% of components)
3. clients render data struct
4. clients manipulating data struct then send coords to the server
5. server running own struct copy of game and can agree/disagree and force client to redraw the whole thing or say 'OK'
6. think about what scoring system can be
